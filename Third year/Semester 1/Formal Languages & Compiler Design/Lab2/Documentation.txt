 Hash Table data structure

Properties: table (array) and size (int).

  __init__(self, size):

        Constructor for the HashTable.

        Description: The constructor for the HashTable takes an integer "size" as an input parameter,
        which represents the size of the hash table. The table is initialized with the given size, and
        each position is initialized with an empty list.

        Input:
        - size (int): The size of the hash table.

        Output:
        - None


  getSize(self):

        Get the size of the hash table.

        Description: This method returns the size of the hash table.

        Input:
        - None

        Output:
        - int: The size of the hash table.


__hash(self, key):
        """
        Calculate the hash value for a key.

        Description: This private method calculates the hash value for a given key. It returns a tuple
        containing the hash value and the index where the key should be stored in the hash table.

        Input:
        - key (any): The key to be hashed.

        Output:
        - tuple: A tuple containing the hash value and the index.


add(self, key):

        Add a key to the hash table.

        Description: This method adds a key to the hash table.

        Input:
        - key (any): The key to be added.

        Output:
        - None

remove(self, key):

        Remove a key from the hash table.

        Description: This method removes a key from the hash table if it exists.

        Input:
        - key (any): The key to be removed.

        Output:
        - None


contains(self, key):

        Check if a key is in the hash table.

        Description: This method checks if a key is present in the hash table and returns a boolean
        value indicating the result.

        Input:
        - key (any): The key to be checked.

        Output:
        - bool: True if the key is found, False otherwise.


getIndex(self, value):

        Get the index of a specified value in the hash table.

        Description: This method returns the index of a specified value within the hash table, or -1 if
        the value is not found.

        Input:
        - value (any): The value to be searched for within the hash table.

        Output:
        - int: The index of the specified value or -1 if not found.


__str__(self):

        Generate a string representation of the hash table.

        Description: This method generates a string representation of the hash table, displaying the
        (hash value, index) pairs and their associated keys.

        Input:
        - None

        Output:
        - str: A string representation of the hash table.
